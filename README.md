# Weather-Monitoring-
The primary goal of this project is to develop a real-time data processing system that monitors weather conditions across various metropolitan cities in India. The system retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes it to provide summarized insights, and alerts users based on configurable thresholds.
